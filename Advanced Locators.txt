Advanced Locators


We are going to learn about xpaths. Xpaths are powerful locators to easily find element in automation


There are two types of xpaths:- Absolute and Relative

*Absolute xpaths*

These xpaths start from the root level for ex:

<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<h1 id="heading"></h1>
</body>
</html>

If I want to access h1 

then to access it using relative xpath we will have /html/head/body/h1



*Relative xpath*

We can directly access an element using this type of xpath and dont really have to go from the root level


//h1[@id="heading"]


Attributes in relative xpath

1) @attribute='value'

2) text()='' on the basis of text

3) contains()= '' on the basis of the contain of the element

4) starts-with()='' if the text starts with something

5) we can use index as well like if two elements have the same attributes then we can use something  like //h1[@id="heading"][1] and //h1[@id="heading"][2] to access first and the second element

6) Xpath axes

a) parent:: - access direct parent of the element

b) child:: - access the direct child of the element

c) following-sibling:: access the next sibling of the element

d) preceding-sibling:: access the previous sibling of the element

e) ancestor:: go up multiple levels to the root parent element

f) descendant:: show all the children of the elements
